# What is this project?
It has two parts. The first is a webmap:

Right now, there is no easy online or offline way to see all the Los Angeles region food banks and their hours of operation. We want to make it easier for people to find their nearest food bank that will be open today and tomorrow. Once complete the map will be hosted by the LA Regional Food Bank so that those in need can more easily find resources.

The second part is to compile a pool of hunger data: 

The LA Regional Food Bank recently was accepted into ESRI's program for Non-Profit organizations. We want to get them started right so we'll be gathering relevant data on hunger in LA County. This will be used for a MaptimeLA night on data visualization. The data will then be added to the LA Regional Food Bank's ArcGIS Online portal. Any public data will remain here as well for others to use.
 
*Current Project Status:* Data research, data cleaning/formatting, adding data to OpenStreetMaps

Truth Table Completion: The truth table that will power the symbology of the webmap is currently complete, other than a few issues that need to be resolved. No additional assistance is currently needed for this part of the project thanks to Nina.

OSM Updates:
There is also a column in the Google Sheet indicating whether the Food Pantry has been added to Open Street Map. OSM alreadh has a category for food pantries. Many are housed in churches and community centers, so be sure to distinguish between the organization and the food pantry in how you name the point added to the map. Be sure to add the contact number and hours to the point as well. If you are part of Maptime LA, please include #Maptime and #MaptimeLA in your commit notes. Be sure to request access to the Google Sheet so you can let others know a Food Pantry has been added to OSM.

Data Gathering:
Some relevant data will be derived from the Food Pantry locations once they are geocoded, such as drive time areas. Other data that would be relevant to the mission of the Food Bank needs to be compiled and prepared for the upcoming Maptime LA Hunger Data Night and eventual upload to ArcGIS Online.

Examples Include: Census Poverty Data for LA County, Census Block Outlines for LA County, Census Statistics on usage of Food Stamps and WIC Benefits for LA County, Supermarket Locations, State Legislative District Boundaries, Federal Congressional District Boundaries.
